To modulate generated sound based on navigated instrument position, orientation, etc., 3D Slicer sends parametersusing OpenSoundControl protocol.

OpenSoundControl module is for configuring and testing OpenSoundControl server communication.

SoundNavigation module is for automatic generation of OpenSoundControl messages for tool navigation, from tool and reference transform nodes.
